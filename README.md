The number of international passengers per month on an airline (Pan Am) in the united states were obtained
from the Fedral Aviation Administration for the period 1949-1960. The company used the data to predict
future demand before ordering new aircraft and training aircrew.

1.Plot Time series for the given data


2. Check for seasonality, trend and stationarity of the given time series


3.find the best ARIMA model

4.Forecast the model for next 12 months using arima and compute prediction intervals of 95% confidence
level for each prediction.

5. arima() fits the model using maximum likelihood estimation. Now, plot the Q-Q plots, which measures
the agreement of a fitted distribution with observed data


6. Check the stationarity of timeseries using Augemented Dickey-Fuller test.
